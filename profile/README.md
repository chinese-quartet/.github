### Pipelines
#### [For DNAseq](https://github.com/chinese-quartet/quartet-dseqc-report)
Quartet DSeQC Report is a quality assessment tool for WGS/WES data. It supports two format: Fastq and vcf. And it contains three subcommands: fq-workflow, vcf-workflow and report. The fq-workflow command takes raw reads (in FASTQ format), produces a set of qc result files from them.

If you would like to analyze your data on your own server, please follow [the document](https://docs.chinese-quartet.org/data_pipelines/genomics/intro/#analyze-your-data-on-your-own-server)

If not, you can analyze your data on our cloud platform [Quartet Data Portal](https://chinese-quartet.org/#/seq-flow/app-store)

#### [For RNAseq](https://github.com/chinese-quartet/quartet-rseqc-report)
Quartet RSeQC Report is a quality assessment tool for RNA-seq data. It contains two subcommands: workflow and report. The workflow command takes raw reads (in FASTQ format), produces a set of qc result files from them (More details on RNA-Seq QC for Quartet). and you can use report command to report the results finally.
